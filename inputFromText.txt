Inputs from text - Idea:
- Initialize a list of gates, including IOs
- When processing an IO, get its position, and initialize the ios list as well
- Make inCons and outCons dict on-the-go
- Create a Grid object based on these data (we need a Grid object, then it's
  easy to do placement)

Idea: the names of the gates are integer numbers (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, ....).
    So when we create the inCons and outCons dict, we can specify the gate by
    gateList[index]

format of gate:
    number of gates
    name(id) [space] gateDelay(arrival time) [space] isIO?

format of output connections (then also add input connections)
    (each line is information for a gate)
    originGateID [space] gateOutput1 [space] gateOutput2 [space] ....
    originGateID (this gate has no output connection)

class Gate to represent each gate in the circuit. 
    A Gate object stores gate-related information like name, delay, interconnections.

class TopoSort to do topological sorting for the gates.

class Grid to represent a layout. 
    A Grid will store a list of gates in the layout, show the position of each gate
    in the layout, contain the interconnection info between gates. 

class Placement is used to do the placement-for-tree algorithm. Since placement-for-tree
and placement-for-DAG will be two different algorithms, I want to make sure other
classes like Gate and Grid will work with both algorithms. 

Pseudocode for the placement-for-tree algo is listed in the paper.
